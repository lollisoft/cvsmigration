# cvsmigration
This repo just contains my script (git-migration-init.sh for fresh initialization and git-migration-local.sh for updates from CVS to Git) how I have migrated my CVS version history with tags from two branches. The migraton was done for my main CPP project (https://github.com/lollisoft/lbdmf).

A new migration was added for my pascal stone age stuff.
